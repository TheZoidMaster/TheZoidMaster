# hey there :wave:, i'm zoid!
welcome to my github! i'm a programmer who loves messing around with code, building random projects, and sometimes making games. you’ll find a mix of everything here—minecraft mods, lua scripts, and maybe some upcoming secret projects :eyes:.

## what i'm into:
- coding: my top languages (according to vscode anyways) are lua, python, java, and typescript
- gaming: big into minecraft, sometimes making mods for it
- tech tinkering: always trying to make something work better (or break it more creatively)

## some of my current projects:
- working on an [anki cozmo revival](https://github.com/RazuProject/) (still a wip)
- "maintaining" a [vencord fork](https://github.com/Zoidcord/Zoidcord)
- a large minecraft content mod that adds ***[REDACTED]*** to the ***[DATA EXPUNGED]***

feel free to browse around, fork something, or drop me a message. i'm always up for a chat about code, gaming, or anything really.
