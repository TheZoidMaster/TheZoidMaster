# hi i'm zoid :wave:
welcome to the hellhole that is my github profile. you cant find much here because most of my projects are private until i deem them ready for the public. most, if not all of my stuff is wip. even me.
## stuff im interested in:
* languages like python, lua, c#, typescript, and javascript. (i know more than this but i dont use them much at all)
* games such as (but ofc not limited to) minecraft, roblox, some vr stuff like beat saber, and staring at the ceiling until i question why i exist. yknow, the regular stuff.
* absolutely destroying things. watching computers break is quite fun ([rtc](https://redscientist.com/rtc) my beloved)
* music, music, and more music (more specifically, tally hall and similar ig)
* art. i still need to convince myself to start learning but art is cool :3
* furry fandom, if you couldnt tell by my pfp
* also programming (obviously)
* probably more that im too tired to remember
## the few things you *can* find on my profile:
* botulism -- a wip discord ai chatbot framework
* nullify -- wip spotify integration for skipping specific songs/artists/albums
* my site's source ([zoid.one](https://zoid.one) btw. also check out [jae's page](https://jae.zoid.one/))
* cee -- a (heavily wip) rewrite of [@jaegerwalddev](https://github.com./jaegerwalddev)'s kee, an encryption language
* [figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) libraries (only an ik library atm)
* some random ass minecraft mods that probably dont work anymore
* keelib (depricated) -- python library for kee
* some other random stuff that no one will be interested in
* again, probably more that im too tired to remember
## stuff that i work on that *isnt* on my profile
* nexulien -- a vencord fork run by someone other than vendicated, with some other cool features like a ui overhaul
* razu -- an anki cozmo revival project (though it seems to have gone mostly inactive)
* astrinox -- minecraft modding organization that desperately needs cpr
* gkko (gecko) -- nothing to be concerned about yet, in fact, none of that stuff is public yet so good luck figuring out what it is :trollface:
* martyrdome -- [redacted]
* i think this is actually all this time, not too many organizations to remember
## need to contact me for some reason?
my preferred platform is discord, @thezoidmaster. alternatively, zoid@zoid.one (i dont check my email much so good luck with that one).
## my stats (proof that i do actually do stuff sometimes :sob:):
